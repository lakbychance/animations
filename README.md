### Animations

- [Linear Product Direction](https://linear.app/method/product-direction) - To make this, extensive AI was used for canvas manipulation.
- [Gooey Tooltip](https://rauno.me/craft) - To make this, referred to [this](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2024/11/18/how-to-create-a-gooey-search-interaction-with-framer-motion-and-react/) article.
- Blackhole - Came across [this](https://rauno.me/craft/vercel#orbit-rings) and the Code completion engine section of https://poolside.ai/ which provided the inspiration for the blackhole. Ultimately settled on stroke-dasharray and stroke-dashoffset to create the effect instead of offsetPath/textPath.
- Peerlist Scroll Feed Tabs - Recreation of feed tabs navigation animation on [Peerlist](https://peerlist.io/scroll)
