- [Linear Product Direction](https://linear.app/method/product-direction) - To make this, extensive AI was used for canvas manipulation.

- Blackhole - Came across [this](https://rauno.me/craft/vercel#orbit-rings) and the Code completion engine section of https://poolside.ai/ which provided the inspiration for the blackhole. Ultimately settled on stroke-dasharray and stroke-dashoffset to create the effect instead of offsetPath/textPath.
